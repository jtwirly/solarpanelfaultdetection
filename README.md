# Solar Panel Fault Detection System

## Overview
This project is a machine learning-powered web application that detects and classifies faults in solar panels using computer vision. The system can analyze both single images and batch process multiple images to identify three conditions:
- Clean panels
- Physical damage
- Electrical damage

This project was partly inspired by [AIAnytime's Waste Classifier project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3e2JJxvwPM) and adapted its initial codebase from their [waste classification system](https://github.com/AIAnytime/Waste-Classifier-Sustainability-App).

## Features
- Single image analysis with detailed confidence scores
- Batch processing capability for multiple panels
- Real-time analysis with progress tracking
- Downloadable results in CSV format
- User-friendly interface built with Streamlit
- High accuracy fault detection using TensorFlow Lite

## Tech Stack
- Python

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jtwirly/solarpanelfaultdetection/
cd solarpanelfaultdetection
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Click "New app" and select:
   - Repository: solarpanelfaultdetection
   - Branch: main
   - Main file path: app.py

4. Click "Deploy"

Your app will be available at: https://[your-username]-solarpanelfaultdetection-streamlit-app.streamlit.app or whatever you choose to set the URL as.

Note: The repository already includes:
- `converted_model.tflite` (TensorFlow Lite model)
- `labels.txt` (Class labels)
- `requirements.txt` (Dependencies)

No additional configuration is needed for deployment.

## Usage

### Single Image Analysis
1. Select the "Single Image Analysis" tab
2. Upload a solar panel image
3. Click "Analyze Image"
4. View the results showing:
   - Panel condition
   - Confidence score
   - Detailed probability breakdown

### Batch Analysis
1. Select the "Batch Analysis" tab
2. Upload multiple solar panel images
3. Click "Analyze All Images"
4. Monitor the progress bar
5. View summary statistics and detailed results
6. Download results as CSV if needed

## Model Performance
The current model achieves:
- High confidence scores for clean panels (typically >90%)
- Accurate detection of physical damage patterns
- Reliable identification of electrical faults
- Fast inference time suitable for real-time analysis

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with drone imagery systems
- Time series analysis for degradation tracking
- Automated report generation
- Geographic mapping of panel conditions
- Mobile app development

## Customizing the Project
This project can be adapted for various energy infrastructure monitoring applications. Check `otherideas.txt` for a comprehensive list of potential adaptations.

### Creating Your Own Model
1. **Prepare Your Dataset**
   - Collect ~50+ images per category. You could find a dataset through a website like Kaggle or create your own dataset.
   - Ensure diverse conditions (lighting, angles, distances)
   - Include both positive and negative examples
   - Label your images consistently

2. **Train Using Google Teachable Machine**
   - Visit [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)
   - Create a new Image Project
   - Upload your images for each class and name each class

   - Set training parameters:
     ```
     Epochs: 50 (adjust based on performance)
     Batch Size: 16
     Learning Rate: 0.001
     ```

   - Train the model
   - Test it with other images
   - Export as TensorFlow Lite

3. **Modify the Code**
   - Update `labels.txt` with your categories:
     ```
     0 YourClass1
     1 YourClass2
     2 YourClass3
     ```
   - Rename your model to `converted_model.tflite`
   - Adjust the display messages in `app.py`:
     ```python
     def format_condition(condition):
         """Format condition text for display"""
         if condition == "YourClass1":
             return "Your Display Text 1"
         elif condition == "YourClass2":
             return "Your Display Text 2"
         return condition
     ```

4. **Customize the Interface**
   - Modify the code in app.py (you can use Claude or ChatGPT to help if desired)
   - Modify the title and descriptions
   - Adjust confidence thresholds if needed
   - Add custom metrics relevant to your use case
   - Update the results display format

### Best Practices for Adaptation
1. **Data Collection**
   - Use real-world examples
   - Include various environmental conditions
   - Consider seasonal variations
   - Document image sources and conditions

2. **Model Training**
   - Start with default parameters
   - Experiment with learning rates
   - Monitor for overfitting
   - Validate with test images

3. **Testing & Validation**
   - Use a separate test dataset
   - Verify performance across all categories
   - Test edge cases
   - Document accuracy metrics

4. **Deployment Considerations**
   - Update requirements.txt if needed
   - Test thoroughly before deployment
   - Consider scalability
   - Document any special requirements

### Example Adaptation (Wind Turbine)
```python
# Example labels.txt for wind turbine inspection
0 Normal
1 BladeDamage
2 IceAccumulation
3 Corrosion

# Example condition formatting
def format_condition(condition):
    conditions = {
        "Normal": "‚úÖ Normal Operation",
        "BladeDamage": "üö® Blade Damage Detected",
        "IceAccumulation": "‚ùÑÔ∏è Ice Accumulation",
        "Corrosion": "‚ö†Ô∏è Corrosion Detected"
    }
    return conditions.get(condition, condition)
```
